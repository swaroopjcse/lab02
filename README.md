# Lab 02: Familiarising yourself with the cp library

## Objectives

In this lab, you will learn about --

* accessing the cp-library documentation
* using basic `cp::print` operation
* the output log on the docker environment

We assume you have already set your working environments according to the  instructions.

## Steps

Using the VS Code extension you have configured, download this starter code. (If you are reading this in VSCode, you have already done this step.)

First, look at the contents of the folder:

```sh
├── Data
├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── cp-0.1.0-Linux
├── errors.txt
├── main.cpp
└── output.txt
```

Let's look at each one of these.

1. `Data/` contains the configurations for running your program on the underlying docker instance. **Do not make any changes** to the contents of this folder.
2. `Makefile` is a program that is invoked when you click the **Run** button in VS Code. We will not go into how it compiles and executes your code at this point. Again, make **no changes to the Makefile**.
3. `README.md` is this file.
